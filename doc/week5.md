Week 5 - Juhani Imberg
======================

What have I learned this week?
------------------------------

* How frustrating debugging can be when nothing gets accomplished
* Programming languages are hard
* C is hard

Unresolved things

* How to get `asek_` to respond on IRC
* How to get a response on tiralabtool
* How to get my code review partner to open his GitHub issues
* How to design a programming language

How is the program progressing
------------------------------

* Not very well
* I have been debugging the GC the whole week, several hours every night
* Possibly due to the lack of sleep I haven't solved the problem yet
* Some documentation was written how ever
* Still sick

What will I do next
-------------------

* The same as always
* Struggle to get the GC to work properly
